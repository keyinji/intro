Topics: 
  What is a programming language
  What is python
  Basics of python 

What is PL
  Computer speak
  The opposite of a natural language or human language
  Same: syntax and gramamr
  Very rigid, one wrong move and is all over => bugs and errrs
  EVERY software is made via a PL
  there  are tons of PL
    Java, C, Javascript, Assembly machine language (binary)
  2 kinds of PLs:
    We must turn any PL into binary. How?
    1. Compiled
      uses a compiler to output a new program in binary
      INPUT: a program in the given PL (a file, "myprogram.java")
      OUTPUT: executable, a new program that is in binary
      PLs that use this: Java, C, C++, C#
    2. Interpreted
      reads each line one at a time
      And turns each line one at a time into binary => sends it to CPU 
      PLs that are interpeted: Python, JS, Java
    Questions:
      How are compiled and interpereted processes different?
        Compiler: A compiler translates code from a high-level programming language into machine code before the program runs. Interpreter: An interpreter translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs.
      Will compiling run a program? Will interpreting run a program?
        No it gives you back an executable that does not run it. An interpreter runs immediately 
      Why would you use one over the other? What are the advantages of either?
        Compiler easier to share code, Python (interpeted) 3.1.7 vs 3.1.5 while CPU will run the same generally (binary code)
        Compiler faster to run
        An interpeter faster to make code 
      
  
What is python
Free and Open source software (FOSS, FLOSS)
  It's always going to be free
  Anyone can look at the source code, ANYONE can contribute
  Contrast with: closed source. proprietary software like Microsoft
  Python FOSS but also a company

Python has versions 
  updated over the years
  started with v1, v2 2000s. v3 today. difference between each version is huge, be careful

Python has a ton of application
  Science, data science, in industry. taken java or overtaken java, AI, health studies, 
  Big pros: easier, syntax isn't so bad
