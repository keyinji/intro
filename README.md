## What is a Programming Language (PL)

- **Computer speak:** The opposite of a natural or human language.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Same as natural languages: syntax and grammar.
  - Very rigid: One wrong move can lead to bugs and errors.
- **Every software** is made via a programming language.
- There are many programming languages:
  - Java
  - C
  - JavaScript
  - Assembly
  - Machine language (binary)

### Types of Programming Languages

1. **Compiled Languages:**
   - Uses a compiler to output a new program in binary.
   - **INPUT:** A program in the given PL (e.g., "myprogram.java").
   - **OUTPUT:** An executable, a new program that is in binary.
   - **Examples:** Java, C, C++, C#

2. **Interpreted Languages:**
   - Reads each line one at a time and converts it into binary, sending it to the CPU.
   - **Examples:** Python, JavaScript

### Questions

- **How are compiled and interpreted processes different?**
  - **Compiler:** Translates code from a high-level programming language into machine code before the program runs.
  - **Interpreter:** Translates code from a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs.

- **Will compiling run a program? Will interpreting run a program?**
  - Compiling produces an executable that does not run the program immediately.
  - Interpreting runs the program immediately.

- **Why would you use one over the other? What are the advantages of either?**
  - **Compiled Languages:** Easier to share code. Generally faster to run.
  - **Interpreted Languages:** Faster to develop code. Different versions (e.g., Python 3.1.7 vs. 3.1.5) will run the same binary code on the CPU.

## What is Python

- **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS, FLOSS):**
  - Always free.
  - Anyone can view and contribute to the source code.
  - **Contrast with:** Closed source, proprietary software like Microsoft products.
  - Python is FOSS but also supported by a company.

- **Python Versions:**
  - Updated over the years.
  - Started with v1, v2 in the 2000s, and v3 today.
  - Differences between versions can be significant, so be cautious.

- **Applications of Python:**
  - Science
  - Data science
  - Industry applications
  - AI
  - Health studies
  - Big pros: Easier to learn, less complex syntax compared to some other languages.

- **Python as a Calculator:**
  - Can perform simple math operations.
  - Uses parentheses to enforce order of operations (PEMDAS).
